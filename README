Playing with giant datasets. An attempt to map all of the knowledge in the world by
drawing connections between Wikipedia topics. Will identify which topics are the
most influential in general knowledge, as well as what each topic is related to by
links. Hopefully I'll learn how to make a visualization too, that'd be awesome.

Files:
    - wikiXML_to_sql.py         : Reads a wiki XML file, grabs each article, and stores id, title, and content in MySQL
    - page_parser.py            : Referenced from https://github.com/gareth-lloyd/visualizing-events
                                    Creates an XML parser optimized for long files and designed to store wiki articles
    - article_link_extractor.py : Reads a wiki_index DB table, makes a WikiPage object from each row, identifies every
                                    link in the text, and adds it to a list, returning a list of links for each page.
