Playing with giant datasets. An attempt to map all of the knowledge in the world by
drawing connections between Wikipedia topics. Will identify which topics are the
most influential in general knowledge, as well as what each topic is related to by
links. Hopefully I'll learn how to make a visualization too, that'd be awesome.
